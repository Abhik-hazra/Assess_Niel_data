# Assess_Niel_data

This repo contains the Nielsen Critical Assessment data to be pulled into Collab

## Getting Started

Recently, I was contacted by a Nielsen recruitment team, and they gave me a take-home assessment. It was a marketing analytics team. 
I am posting both the Notebook that they had sent me and also the solution I came up with. 

## The Notebooks
* [Nielsen Assessment](https://github.com/Abhik-hazra/Assess_Niel_data/blob/main/Critical%20Thinking%20Assessment.ipynb) - The Notebook sent to me.
* [Solution](https://github.com/Abhik-hazra/Assess_Niel_data/blob/main/Solution%20-%20Critical%20Thinking%20Assessment.ipynb) - The Solution I created

## End
Overall this was a short coding project, though I am very confused about the TBL column formula that they have mentioned in the code.
The data uploaded here, has been cleaned.
