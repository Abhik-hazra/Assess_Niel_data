# Assess_Niel_data

This repo contains the Nielsen Critical Assessment data to be pulled into Collab

## Getting Started

Recently, I was contacted by a Nielsen recruitment team, and they gave me a take-home assessment. It was a marketing analytics team. 
I am posting both the Notebook that they had sent me and parts of the solution that I came up with. I am uploading this, just as an overview for anyone preparing for interviews and get ahead quickly. However, I just spent a few hours on the notebook and I haven't worked thoroughly on the Logistic regression part due to lack of time. 

## The Notebooks
* [Nielsen Assessment](https://github.com/Abhik-hazra/Assess_Niel_data/blob/main/Critical%20Thinking%20Assessment.ipynb) - The Notebook sent to me.
* [Solution](https://github.com/Abhik-hazra/Assess_Niel_data/blob/main/Solution%20-%20Critical%20Thinking%20Assessment.ipynb) - My workings

## Closing remarks
Uploading this for anyone who wants to explore and prepare for interviews. Also, I'm cleaning up my Laptop. 
Overall this was a short coding project, though I was very confused about the TBL column formula that they mentioned in the code. Also, the logistic regression they asked to carry out, didn't yield any result. I would need to further work and look at the features closely. But, as this was just for an interview arranged in a short time frame, I didn't spend any more time solving this. 
The data uploaded to the repository has been cleaned.
